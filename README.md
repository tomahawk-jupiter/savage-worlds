# Savage Worlds Interactive Character sheet

An interactive character sheet for the TTRPG savage worlds. You can roll dice, improve character stats, fill in name, background info, etc.

It uses local storage for saving / loading character sheets. Can save multiple.

I use React and Redux for the state management.

Its not currently responsive, the min width is 900px.

I manually setup webpack instead of using create react app so it makes a good reference for a simple webpack React setup.
